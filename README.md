# 🖼️ Image Classifier

A deep learning-based image classification project that identifies and classifies images into predefined categories. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy on visual recognition tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Image Classifier is designed to:
- Take an input image
- Process it through a trained CNN model
- Predict and output the class label of the image

It can be used for applications such as:
- Object detection
- Face recognition
- Medical image analysis
- Industrial automation

## 🚀 Features

- Image pre-processing and augmentation
- Training with Convolutional Neural Networks
- Evaluation and accuracy tracking
- Live prediction with new images
- Model saving and loading for reuse

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (customizable)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image input/output)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python script
